It is divided into 3 entities that can be extended separately: Problem, Algorithm, and Solution. The rest of the code is to create these entities and glue them together as shown in the Figure.</p><p>::: center <img src="../assets/img/diagram.png" alt="The QSS Solver Structure."/>{#fig:qssdiag width=&quot;10cm&quot; height=&quot;6cm&quot;} :::</p><p>The API was designed to provide an easier way to handle events than the approach provided by the classic integration solvers.

The core components of the solver include the NLodeProblem function, the solve function, the scheduler, the quantizer, and the solution object. These components work together to parse user-provided code, solve the system of ODEs using QSS algorithms, and store the results for analysis. The following sections provide an in-depth explanation of the key components and their interactions within the solver framework.</p><h4 id="creating-the-problem"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#creating-the-problem">creating the problem</a><a id="creating-the-problem-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#creating-the-problem" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>The NLodeProblem function is the entry point for defining a new problem to be solved by the QSS solver. It takes user-provided code, which includes system parameters, variables, equations, and event logic, and constructs a Problem object that encapsulates all the necessary information for the solver to simulate the system such as problem dimensions, dependencies, and equations. The function works by parsing the user code and extracting relevant data to populate the Problem object.</p><p><em>NLODEDiscProblem{PRTYPE,T,Z,Y,CS}:</em> This is the struct that holds all the necessary data for a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) problem with discrete events. The structure includes various fields such as initial conditions, discrete variables, Jacobians, event dependencies, and other data related to how the problem is formulated. This structure serves as the core data holder for the problem and will be used in the solver. It is a parametric abstract type that has the following parameters:</p><p>PRTYPE: The type of the problem (to distinguish between various types, and allow future extension of the solver to handle new types).</p><p>T: The number of continuous variables (state variables).</p><p>Z: The number of zero-crossing functions, which are used to detect events.</p><p>Y: The actual number of events.</p><p>CS: Cache size, which is used to store intermediate operations.</p><p>The use of abstract types in this context allows for flexibility and extensibility in the solver. By defining these abstract types, the code can be easily adapted to handle different types of problems, algorithms, and solutions without needing to modify the core solver logic. This design choice enhances the maintainability and scalability of the solver, making it easier to add new features or support additional problem types in the future.</p><p><strong>NLodeProblemFunc:</strong> After an initial preparation performed by the The NLodeProblem function, The function NLodeProblemFunc takes the resulting expressions to continue constructing an instance of the NLODEDiscProblem structure. It works in several key stages:</p><p><em>Initialization:</em> The function begins by initializing vectors and dictionaries that will hold equations (equs), Jacobian dependencies (jac), zero-crossing functions (ZCjac), and event dependencies. These serve to store the different types of equations and their relationships.</p><p><em>Processing ODEs:</em> It loops through each of the ODE expressions provided by the user. Depending on the type of expression (discrete variables, differential equations, or loop constructs), it processes the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation. For differential equations, it extracts dependencies to build the Jacobian and transform the equations into a more appropriate form for further use. Special cases are handled, such as if the RHS is a number or a symbol.</p><p><em>Handling Events:</em> The function also processes event-related constructs (if conditions) that correspond to different points where the system might undergo discrete changes. It process the RHS of the event equations, transforms them into a suitable form, and builds the necessary dependency structures. Specifically, it constructs how discrete and continuous variables influence one another through the events.</p><p><em>Constructing the Function Code:</em> After processing all ODEs and events, the function dynamically generates a Julia function code needed to store the system of ODEs and events. This code is built into a function that handles different cases (i.e., which equation to evaluate based on an index of a state change or an event).</p><p><strong>Building Dependencies:</strong> Several helper functions that build the dependencies between variables, events. They build dependency vectors that track how discrete and continous variables influence the system. This is used to know what variables to update and determine when specific events should be checked. By tracking the relationships between variables and events, the solver can determine the appropriate actions to take at each time step. The dependencies are stored in the following vectors:</p><p>-<span>$jac$</span>: It determines which variables affect a derivative.</p><p>-<span>$ZCjac$</span>: It determines which variables affect a zero-crossing function.</p><p>-<span>$SD$</span>: It determines which derivatives that are affected by a given variable.</p><p>-<span>$SZ$</span>: It determines which zero-crossing functions that are affected by a given variable.</p><p>-<span>$HZ$</span>: It tells which Zero-crossing functions influenced by a given event.</p><p>-<span>$HD$</span>: It tells which derivatives influenced by a given event.</p><p>Here&#39;s a quick summary and what each helper function is doing:</p><p><em>extractJacDepNormal:</em> It Extracts the dependencies for normal (non-loop) expressions. It updates the Jacobian matrix <span>$jac$</span> and a dictionary <span>$dD$</span> for tracking dependencies of derivatives to discrete variables.</p><p><em>extractJacDepLoop:</em> Similar to extractJacDepNormal, but specifically for loop expressions. It tracks dependencies across loop iterations.</p><p><em>extractZCJacDepNormal:</em> It Extracts zero-crossing Jacobian dependencies for discrete variables (<span>$dZ$</span>), and it updates <span>$zcjac$</span>, <span>$SZ$</span>.</p><p><em>createDependencyToEventsDiscr:</em> It maps discrete dependencies (dD, dZ) to specific events, it and constructs dependency matrices HZ and HD from the discrete variables only.</p><p><em>createDependencyToEventsCont:</em> Similar to createDependencyToEventsDiscr, but for continuous dependencies (SD, sZ), and it updates the matrices HZ and HD from the continuous variables only.</p><p><em>unionDependency:</em> Merges the two previous sets of dependencies (continuous and discrete) into the final matrices HZ and HD.</p><h4 id="The-solve-function"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-solve-function">The solve function</a><a id="The-solve-function-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-solve-function" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>The solve function is the primary interface for solving non-linear ODE problems using various QSS (Quantized State Systems) algorithms. It does this by dispatching on the problem and algorithm types to select the right solver.</p><p><strong>QSS Algorithm:</strong> The diagram shows three specific algorithms: (QSS Algorithm, LiQSS Algorithm, mLiQSS Algorithm). The Algorithm type is parametric on the solver name (N) and order (O). When a user doesn&#39;t provide a solver explicitly, the solve function defaults to using the modified second-order implicit algorith (mLiQSS2). This approach allows flexibility: the user can select a different algorithm by providing an alternative QSS Algorithm without needing to modify the solve function. Based on the QSS Algorithm provided, it either selects a basic QSS integration method or, in the case of LiQSS, constructs additional data structures needed for implicit integration. The method defaults to sparse handling as false (Val(false)), tolerances (abstol=1e-4 and reltol=1e-3), and a maximum number of iterations (maxiters=1e7). These parameters can be adjusted based on the problem&#39;s complexity and desired accuracy.</p><p><strong>Helper Functions:</strong></p><p><em>createCommonData:</em> This function sets up the common data required by the QSS solver. It initializes all necessary vectors (x, q, tx, tq, nextStateTime, etc.) used in the integration process, and it pre-allocates a cache of Taylor series to avoid repeated memory allocation during integration (taylorOpsCache).</p><p><em>getClosure:</em> This function creates a closure for the Jacobian and the dependency matrices, allowing in a flexible in a way that enables easy extension. The closure is used to access the Jacobian matrix during the integration process.</p><p><em>createLiqssData:</em> For LiQSS solvers, this function sets up additional data structures and auxiliary variables used for storing linear approximation coefficients.</p><h4 id="The-scheduler-function"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-scheduler-function">The scheduler function</a><a id="The-scheduler-function-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-scheduler-function" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>The scheduler component retrieves the next index (a state change or an event) for processing. It determines the next action by comparing three types of timing events: state updates, events, and input updates. It initializes minimum time variables for each action type to infinity and iterates through the provided vectors to find the minimum times and their corresponding indices. Based on these comparisons, it decides whether the next scheduled action is an input update, an event, or a state update. If no valid actions are found (indicated by a zero index), the function assigns a default state indicating the next action is a state update at time infinity. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the index of the next action, its time, and a symbol representing the type of action to take next (:STINPUT, :STEVENT, or :STSTATE). This structure ensures that the simulation progresses accurately and efficiently.</p><h4 id="The-Quantizer-functions"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Quantizer-functions">The Quantizer functions</a><a id="The-Quantizer-functions-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Quantizer-functions" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>The system handles different quantizer orders (Order 1 and Order 2). It defines methods for state integration, derivative computation, event time computation, updating quantized values, and cycle detection updates.</p><p><strong>Utils:</strong> This section contains utility functions like root finding that assist in the solution process.</p><p><strong>computeNextTime:</strong> for first-order, the state of the system changes at a constant rate. The core calculation takes place when the first derivative of the state, represented by <span>$x[i][1]$</span>, is non-zero. In this case, the function determines the time to the next event by dividing a quantum threshold by this derivative. Additionally, to prevent numerical issues, it ensures that this calculated time-step does not fall below a predefined minimum value, <span>$absDeltaT$</span>. If the first derivative is extremely small or essentially zero, the function adjusts it to avoid potential numerical instabilities that could arise from very small time increments.</p><p>For second-order, the system state evolves with both a rate of change (first derivative) and acceleration (second derivative). The core calculation occurs when the second derivative of the state, represented by <span>$x[i][2]$</span>, is non-zero. In this case, the function computes the time to the next event by using the square root of the ratio between a quantum threshold and the second derivative. This ensures that the time-step reflects the influence of the system&#39;s acceleration. Additionally, to prevent numerical issues (such as division by zero or overly small time-steps), a minimum delta time (absDeltaT) is enforced. If the computed time-step is smaller than this threshold, the function adjusts the second derivative to maintain stability. If the second derivative is zero but the first derivative is non-zero, the time to the next event is calculated based on the first derivative. The function ensures that the time-step does not drop below absDeltaT, adjusting the first derivative if necessary. If both derivatives are zero, the system is assumed to have no change, and the next event time is set to infinity (Inf).</p><p><strong>recomputeNextTime:</strong> The reComputeNextTime functions are used in the explicit QSS algorithms to enable the recalculation of the next time after interactions between different variables, such as variable i and variable j. These functions determine the time until the system crosses the quantum threshold by solving polynomial equations derived from the difference between the quantized state and the actual state. In situations where the quantum threshold has already been surpassed, they promptly return a very small time increment (e.g., simt + 1e-12) to trigger an immediate update of the system&#39;s state.</p><p><strong>LiqssrecomputeNextTime:</strong> In the LIQSS methods of first-order, the recomputeNextTime function calculates the next event time based on the current state (x), its first derivative (x1), and the quantized state (q). First, if the difference between the current state and the quantized state exceeds twice the quantum size, the next event is scheduled almost immediately with a small time-step. Otherwise, if the derivative is non-zero, the function computes the time-step by dividing the state difference by the derivative. If the result is positive, this time is added to the current simulation time (simt). If negative, it adjusts the time-step by either adding or subtracting twice the quantum size based on the direction of change. If the derivative is zero, indicating no change, the event time is set to infinity. Lastly, if the computed time is in the past, the function resets it to a far future time to prevent any premature events. This ensures that the system evolves smoothly and accurately.</p><p>In the second-order LIQSS method, the recomputeNextTime function calculates the next event time by considering both the state (x) and its first (x1) and second (x2) derivatives, along with the quantized state (q). The function constructs a polynomial using the current state, derivative values, and the second derivative, then calculates the next event time by finding the smallest positive root of this polynomial.</p><p><strong>computeNextInputTime:</strong> The computeNextInputTime functions focus on computing the next action when derivatives depend only on time. They assess changes in the derivatives over a specified elapsed time to compute the time increment until the next input action. If the derivatives are null, the function reverts to handling the system in a lower-order thus simplifying the calculation.</p><p><strong>computeNextEventTime:</strong> The computeNextEventTime function calculates the next event time based on the zero-crossing function (<span>$ZCFun$</span>) of a system. It first checks if a sign change has occurred in the zero-crossing function, indicating that the system is leaving zero and should be considered an event, provided the previous value is significantly different from zero (to prevent duplicate events). If a sign change is detected, the function updates the event time to the current simulation time. If both the old and new values of the zero-crossing function are zero, it sets the next event time to infinity, indicating no event should occur. For cases where the old and new values have the same sign, it calculates the minimum positive root of the zero-crossing function, representing the time of the next event, ensuring that this time is not too close to zero to avoid spurious events. The function then updates the old sign values for future comparisons.</p><h4 id="The-solution"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-solution">The solution</a><a id="The-solution-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-solution" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>This is where the results of the simulation are stored, including: Settings, Time points (times[]), Variables (vars[]), Statistics (stats).</p><p><strong>The solution Struct</strong> The LightSol struct is specifically designed to hold the solution of a system of ODEs. It contains several fields, including size and order, which denote the number of continuous variables and the order of the algorithm used, respectively. The savedTimes and savedVars fields are vectors that store the time steps and corresponding values of the continuous variables at which they were recorded during the simulation. Other fields include algName and sysName, which specify the names of the algorithm and system being solved, alongside absQ, the absolute tolerance used during the simulation. The stats field contains an instance of the Stats struct, providing access to the performance metrics, while ft holds the final time of the simulation. The Stats struct includes fields for totalSteps, which counts the total number of steps taken throughout the simulation, simulStepCount, representing the number of simultaneous updates during the simulation, and evCount, which tallies the number of events that occurred. Additionally, the numSteps vector keeps track of the number of steps taken for each continuous variable involved in the simulation, allowing for detailed analysis of the performance for individual components.</p><p>The functions defined in conjunction with these structs enable various operations related to the simulation&#39;s solutions. The createSol function initializes a LightSol instance with the specified parameters, while the getindex function provides a helper to access either the saved times or variables easily. The evaluateSol function allows for the evaluation of the solution at a specified time, supporting linear interpolation between saved points. Furthermore, the solInterpolated functions enable the generation of interpolated solutions across specified intervals, creating new solution objects based on the interpolated values and times. The show function is tailored to present the statistics in a user-friendly format, offering insights into the performance of the simulation. Overall, these constructs provide a robust framework for managing and analyzing the outcomes of simulations involving ODEs.</p><p><strong>Plotting the Solution:</strong> The plotSol function is designed to visually represent the solution of a system of ODEs stored in the solution object. It accepts a variety of optional parameters, allowing users to customize their plots significantly. The function takes in a solution object sol along with indices for the variables to be plotted (xvars). Users can also specify a title, axis limits (xlims and ylims), and visual styles, such as marker types and whether to display a legend. If a title is not provided, it defaults to a composite of various parameters, including the system name, algorithm name, absolute tolerance, total steps taken, and more.Within the function, each selected variable is plotted against its corresponding saved time, utilizing different line styles for better distinction. If no specific variables are selected, all variables in the solution are plotted by default. After constructing the plot, the function checks for specified axis limits and applies them accordingly. Finally, the function returns the plot object, which can be further modified or saved. In addition to basic plotting, the saveSol function allows users to save their plots as PNG files, automatically generating filenames based on relevant parameters and timestamps. This functionality is crucial for documentation and sharing results in a reproducible manner. This comprehensive plotting capability ensures that users can effectively visualize the behavior of their systems, making the analysis of results intuitive and informative.</p><p><strong>Finding the Error:</strong> The getError function computes the relative error of a solution compared to a specified reference function, enabling users to assess the accuracy of their numerical results. The function iterates over the saved time points, and it calculates the sum of the squares of the differences between the numerical solution and the true values provided by the reference function, as well as the sum of the squares of the true values. The relative error is then derived as the square root of the ratio of these sums, providing a quantitative measure of the solution&#39;s deviation from the expected results. This comprehensive error analysis is essential for validating the performance of numerical methods and ensuring that the solutions produced are both reliable and precise. By comparing the numerical results to known reference values, users can gain insights into the accuracy and effectiveness of the solver, enabling them to make informed decisions about their simulations and analyses.</p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="auto">Automatic (OS)</option><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option><option value="catppuccin-latte">catppuccin-latte</option><option value="catppuccin-frappe">catppuccin-frappe</option><option value="catppuccin-macchiato">catppuccin-macchiato</option><option value="catppuccin-mocha">catppuccin-mocha</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 1.5.0 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Wednesday 23 October 2024 15:28">Wednesday 23 October 2024</span>.
